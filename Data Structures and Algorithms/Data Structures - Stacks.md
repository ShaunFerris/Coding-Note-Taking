The stack is one of the most fundamental data structures in computing and is involved in the running of all computer programs. A stack is a linear data structure that follows a <span style="color: cyan;">last in first out</span> data flow pattern, just like 'the stack' in Magic the Gathering.

A stack data structure has <span style="color: cyan;">four main operations:</span>
1. push() = add an element to the top
2. pop() = remove an element from the top
3. top() = show the element at the top
4. isEmpty() = return a bool that reflects if the stack is empty

The stack is such a fundamental data structure that many computer instruction sets (like assembly) provide special instructions for stack manipulation, and a call stack is the data structure used to handle the execution of programs.

## Stacks and the execution of programs
When we run a program, it is loaded into memory as machine code with instructions stored sequentially. In this view we can look at functions as "mini programs" inside our main program.
