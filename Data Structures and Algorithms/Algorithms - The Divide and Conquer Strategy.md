## Divide and conquer and the concept of algorithm strategies
Sometimes you will come across a problem that can't be solved by any of the algorithms that you have learnt and memorised. This is a situation that will come up all of the time, because it is simply not reasonable nor efficient for every engineer to memorise every algorithm for every task.

<span style="color: cyan; font-weight: bold">A good engineer should have a toolbox of techniques they have seen applied to algorithmic problems that they can apply to new probelems, the Divide and Conquer strategy is one such technique.</span>

The sliding window technique is another such generalised technique that can be applied to multiple algo problems, see here: [[Algorithms - Sliding Window Algorithms]].

This note will go over the DoC strategy generally, outlining how it works and what kind of problems it can be applied to. For a named algorithm that uses the recursive DoC strategy, see the note on quick sort here: [[Algorithms - Quicksort]].
## How to divide and conquer
Divide and Conquer (here on out DoC) is a generalised technique for algorithms, and is by nature **recursive**.
