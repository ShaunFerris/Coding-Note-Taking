A binary search tree is different from the more basic data structures that you are likely already familiar with, because it is not a linear data structure. A BST is type of ordered data structure that stores items and allows for fast searching, addition and subtraction of items.

BSTs keep their items in a sorted order to keep the operations fast, unlike a linked list whose add and remove operations are O(n).
