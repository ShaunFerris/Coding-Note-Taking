This note will serve as the hub for notes related to DSA topics. I will attempt to keep these notes language agnostic in terms of conceptual understanding, but the examples and implementations will likely be written in python. I would like to later come back and add JS solutions side by side with the python ones as practice for switching between both languages but this will be a lower priority than just learning more concepts.

**NOTE:** Bear in mind that a lot of these notes link to other related notes that are not listed in this index. For example the linked list notes carries on to other  notes on variations of the LL data structure.
