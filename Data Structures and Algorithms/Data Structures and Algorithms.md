This note will serve as the hub for notes related to DSA topics. I will attempt to keep these notes language agnostic, but in all likelyhood will use python for the examples.

**Data Structures notes:**
Arrays and array based linear data structures:
- [[Data Structures - Memory and How Arrays Work]]
- [[Data Structures - Using Arrays]]
- [[Data Structures - Linked Lists]]

Stacks and Queues:
- [[Data Structures - Stacks]]
- [[Data Structures - Queues]]
- [[Data Structures - Double Ended Queues]]

Objects, dictionaries and hash maps:
- [[Data Structures - Objects and dictionaries]]
- [[Data Structures - Hash Tables Dictionaries and Associative Arrays]]

Trees and tree based ADTs
- [[Data Structures - Binary Search Trees]]

Also, for constructing custom data structures, revise OOP in python starting from here and following the links to further topics:
- [[Python - OOP - Introduction]]

**Algorithm Notes:**
Algorithms Concepts:
- [[Algorithms - Algorithmic Complexity]]
- [[Algorithms - Big O Notation]]
- [[Algorithms - Space Complexity]]

Algorithms Problems/Examples:
- [[Algorithms - The Matching Brackets Problem]]
- [[Algorithms - Sliding Window Algorithms]]
- [[Algorithms - Three Sum]]
- [[Algorithms - Doubly Linked Lists for Browser Navigation]]
