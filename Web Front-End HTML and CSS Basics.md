## What are HTML and CSS?
HTML stands for HperText Markup Language and is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. Web browsers recieve an html document either from a server or from local storage, and render the webpage based on the html instructions. The html describes semantically the structure and contents of the web page, by describing elements of the webpage such as paragraphs and headings, delineated with tags.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and is an accessory language to HTML, describing the presentation of the elements listed in the html document.

Essentially, html is the main surface along which we interact with the browser, and is used to construct the DOM (see [[Web Front-End - Basics]]). The html includes a reference to the CSS document, which details the styling for classes of tag in the HTML doc.
