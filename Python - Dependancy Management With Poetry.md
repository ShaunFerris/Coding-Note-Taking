Notes in this sectiona are adapted from the [poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/), and from the [codecamp tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-and-publish-python-packages-with-poetry/) on this topic.

Poetry is a command line tool for packaging projects and managing dependancies in isolated virtual environments. When you create a python project for mass consumption, you want to prepare it in such a way that many people with many different systems can simply instal it following a standard set of instructions and have it work in the intended way.

A python package is a collection of modules that can be easily distributed and installed on many different systems without the user needing to preconfigure mofules or other files that the product needs to work (dependancies).

Python packages generally contain a collection of functions or classes that serve a specific purpose, or work together to provide some coherent functionality. OS, sys, math, pandas and numpy are examples of python packages
