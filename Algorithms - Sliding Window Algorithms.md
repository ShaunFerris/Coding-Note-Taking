The sliding window technique is a common strategy for algorithms that need to identify patterns in an array of data that relate to the relative order of elements in the array.

A good simple example of this technique is the following problem from leetcode.com:
<blockquote style="color: cyan; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.</blockquote>
