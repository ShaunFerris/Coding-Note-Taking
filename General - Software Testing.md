## Automated testing for development
The simplest approach to testing a software product and the one almost everyone starts with is manual testing. Once you have debugged the code and there are no errors beign thrown, this is as simple as navigating through the product and checking manually if everything behaves the way you expect or designed it to do so.

This is a good thing to do. It is always helpful the be very familiar with the product and in particular the user experience. However, it is inefficient to be doing this constantly, especially if you are pushing many small changes or micro features in a day, and this is where automated tests fit into the dev workflow.
