#rust 

This note will contain primarily the new syntax and structure I learn going through the guessing game example in the rust docs.

The rust docs are [here](file:///home/shaun/.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/share/doc/rust/html/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html), and the git repo containing my work through of the examples are [here](https://github.com/ShaunFerris/rust-exercises).
