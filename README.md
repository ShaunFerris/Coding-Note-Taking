# Coding-Note-Taking
An Obsidian notes repository for my notes about coding and related topics. As a note, this repository was started after learning python and at the outset of learning JS. Most language specific notes will refer directly to JS and python notes will mostly consist of new things learnt after learning the basics, or topics that I wanted to revise.

## Intended Use
Feel free to make use of these notes for your own study and learning. To view them with proper original formatting and backlinking, it is recommended that you install obsidian from here: https://obsidian.md/download and then open this repo as a vault.
