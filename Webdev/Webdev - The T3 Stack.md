#webdevSpecific 

T3 is a webdev stack that focusses on simplicity, modularity and typesaftey end to end. The docs are [here](https://create.t3.gg/en/introduction).

Going forward from today (20.08.2023) I am going to be picking this stack up. It builds on tech I already use like Next + React + TS, but introduces Trpc and Prisma connected to planetscale. The technologies put together in the stack offer a lot of great benefits to dev experience and the build quality of the final product, and work really well with service providers like Planetscale and Vercel that have extrememly generous free tiers with great dev ex.

## Technologies that make up the stack
Below are notes with quick summaries of the individual technologies that are a part of the stack.
- [[Webdev - Next.js 13 - Basic Introduction]] Next is the main frameword around react, handling routing, webpacking and chunking of code, SSR etc
- [[Typescript - Introduction and Hub]] Built in preconfigured TS support for static testing with typechecks
- [[Webdev - TRPC]] Remote procedure call library using the TS server to check typesafety of communications between the back and front end
- [[Webdev - Prisma ORM]] Prisma handles the object relational mapping of data models to SQL databases
