The Mongoode library is a tool to use with MongoDB for Object Data Modelling (ODM), available on NPM. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

Below is a set of steps generated by chat-GPT for using mongoose and mongoDB to give persistence to a budget tracking application. See also: [[Project Notes - HomeHub - Initial Planning and pre-Launch Development Diary]].

## GPT Instructions
To make the starting budget, amount remaining, and list of expenses persistent across sessions using MongoDB and Mongoose in your Next.js web app, you can follow these steps:

1. Set up MongoDB and Mongoose: Install MongoDB on your server or use a cloud-based MongoDB service. Then, install Mongoose in your Next.js project using the npm or yarn package manager.
    
2. Define a Mongoose Schema: Create a Mongoose schema to define the structure of your budget tracker data. For example, you can have fields like `startingBudget`, `remainingAmount`, and `expenses`. Each expense can have properties like `name`, `amount`, `date`, etc.
    
3. Create a Model: Use the Mongoose schema to create a model that will allow you to interact with the database. You can create a new file called `Budget.js` or similar and define your Mongoose model in it.
    
4. Connect to the MongoDB database: Establish a connection to your MongoDB database in your Next.js app. This can be done in a separate file like `db.js` or directly in your server setup.
    
5. Create and update budget data: Whenever a user sets the starting budget or adds an expense, use Mongoose's model to create or update the budget data in the database. You can do this in an API route or in a function that gets triggered when the user performs a relevant action.
    
6. Retrieve budget data: When a user visits the budget tracker page, retrieve the budget data from the database using Mongoose. You can do this in an API route or a server-side rendering (SSR) function.
    
7. Display the data in your Next.js app: Pass the retrieved budget data as props to your React components and display them on the budget tracker page.
    

By following these steps, your starting budget, amount remaining, and list of expenses will be stored in MongoDB and persist across sessions. Each time a user interacts with the app, the data will be updated in the database, ensuring its persistence.
