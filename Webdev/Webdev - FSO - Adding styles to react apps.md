The example notes app discussed in previous FSO content, like the example apps built for the exercises, have so far not been styled. This means that all the content has been laid out and styled with the browser standard defaults for unstyled HTML.

Here we will look at several ways we can add styles to React apps. The first method covered will be adding CSS the old school way, with a single file and no CSS preprocessor. To get started on this, add a new file called `index.css` to the root of the `src` directory.
