#webdevSpecific 

This note will serve as the hub note for my study notes as I go through the "Full stack open" web development course. I have reached a point in my development as a solo, self taught webdev where I have become a bit stuck in terms of further improvement and inspiration. I have decided to work through this course to brush up on what I already know, and hopefully fill in any gaps.

Impelementing these notes in a way where I don't have to figure out where all the FSO topics fit into my existing notes is a purposeful choice for quality of life.
