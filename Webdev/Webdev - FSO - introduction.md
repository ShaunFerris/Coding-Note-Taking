#webdevSpecific 

This note will serve as the hub note for my study notes as I go through the "Full stack open" web development course. I have reached a point in my development as a solo, self taught webdev where I have become a bit stuck in terms of further improvement and inspiration. I have decided to work through this course to brush up on what I already know, and hopefully fill in any gaps.

Impelementing these notes in a way where I don't have to figure out where all the FSO topics fit into my existing notes is a purposeful choice for quality of life. 

## General info
The course is designed to be a thorough introduction to **modern** webdev with JS. THe focus is on SPA development with React, supporting RESTfull and GQL APIs implmemented with node. This means that the course builds pretty directly on the study that I have already done self directed through Free Code Camp, the mozilla docs and other such sources. 

After completing the course, I will be able to get a cert and credits from the University of Helenski, which is a nice bonus that could be good for the job hunt.

## Course material
The course is meant to be read one part at a time and in order, I intend to take notes from the provided notes, attempting to condense the information as much as possible in this repo.

There are exercises associated with the material, and my solutions to the exercises will be stored in a seperate repo [here](https://github.com/ShaunFerris/fso-exercises).

## Taking the course
The course is fourteen parts, starting at part 0 which is an introduction. The notes taken so far in this document are from part 0. One part of the course is supposed to courespond roughly to one week of study, comprised of approx. 15 to 20 hours. I will be trying to complete the course faster than that, but I'll see how it goes. 

That's about as much of the introductory/taking the course material as I can be bothered summarising here. For the full intro section see the course site [here](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0/general_info#parts-and-completion).
