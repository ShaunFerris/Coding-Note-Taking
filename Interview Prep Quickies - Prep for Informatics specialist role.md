## Summary
Below is an exerpt from the description:
> <span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; color:cyan;"> The role of Informatics Specialist is ideally suited to drug discovery scientists who love coding and implementing new software tools and database developers who are passionate about working with chemical structure databases. </span>
This is a point to hit in the interview.

## Thoughts on some of the responsibilities
Maintaining and developing research databases, information systems and reporting tools. This includes a compound registration system, and presumable some sort of ETL pipeline and associated data-warehouse.

Maintain protocols in ActivityBase: This is a commercial software platform for screening data management. That is, it is a suite of analysis tools and database systems for managing the results and registering compound identites associated with high-throughput/low-throughput or high-content screening runs. See summary of the software from the manufacturer [here](https://www.idbs.com/activitybase/).

Work on template design for HTS and assays for both chemists and biologists.

Development and maintenance of the LIMS and elab notebook systems. WHAT IS A LIMS? it is a Laboratory Information Management System.

Look after the mosaic inventory management system.

Train end users - hit this in interview, teaching lab skills etc.

Work with IT to keep internal tools up - systems engineering. 

Administer the databases.


## Skills
Essential
- Python - got this, could use more experience with pandas/numpy - study up on this a bit
- Cheminformatics api experience - RDKIT prefered. Glide over this, emph on learning quick
- Background in relational database management - kind of same as above
- Understanding of bio assay data - hit the phd here, can support with crystallography
- data pipelining tools like KNIME - gloss, lean on having access to mentor
- active awareness of new and developing tech - lifetime learner, rattle off web tech etc
Nice to have:
- Experience in drug discovery - easy clap, hit modelling screen experience etc
- Template development for ELN systems - experience here, though primitive
- Familiarity with CI/CD and docker - yes
- Web dev, node, react, aws - hit this as hard as possible, link it back how quick I can learn
