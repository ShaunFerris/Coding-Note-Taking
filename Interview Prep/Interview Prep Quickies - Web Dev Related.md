## HTTP
The <span style="color: cyan; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</span>. An application layer protocol that facilitates moving HTML documents over a network. HTTP follows a classical [client-server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model), with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a [stateless protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_protocol), meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.
