#interviewprep

This note serves as a the hub page for interview prep notes which will contain the smallest, pithiest summaries of common interview questions (Note **questions** not **coding challenges**) that I can collect/create. The notes in this area are subdivided by general topic eg: front-end. **HUGE NOTE**: These are not supposed to be comprehensive explanations, just refreshers to prime myself for answers in interviews.
