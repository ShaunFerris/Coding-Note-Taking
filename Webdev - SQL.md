The content of this and related notes is heavily based on the content of the book "Learning SQL" by Alan Beulieu.

## What is SQL and why learn it
SQL or "Structured Query Language" is a language specific to interacting with relational databases.

Why should you learn SQL is not even really a question. If you are going to do anything that works with a relational database then you should learn it, even if you are using an ORM or other layer of abstraction, it is good to know what is going on under the hood.

Learning SQL has the added benefit of forcing you to confront and understand the data structures that you are using to store information.
