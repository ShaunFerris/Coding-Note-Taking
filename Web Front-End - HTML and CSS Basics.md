This note serves as the hub for front-end web design related topics, and as the jumping off point for learning about HTML, CSS and eventually front-end frameworks like react.js.

## How websites are loaded
The term **front-end** refers simply to the parts of an applications code that encode the appearance layer of a web site or application. To get started learning about how to code this appearance layer we should first understand a little about how a website is loaded and displayed by a browser, the software for which websit code is written.

When you type an address into your browser and hit enter, the webiste is then loaded in your browser, but what is actually happening behind the scenes boils down to a series of client-server communications, the client being your browser, and the server being some machine, somewhere in the world, that is hosting the files which make up the website you want to see.
