#projects 

This project is a small toy project to fill time and keep my skills sharp while I study and apply for jobs actively. Feedback from a recent interview has made me doubt homeHub as a resume app because even though it is relatively complex and has a testing suite and other advanced features, it does not impress enough to escape the stigma of "todo apps".

Also taking the opportunity to get more experience using vite rather than next to scaffold the project.

## Dependancies and new tech
Most of the dependancies I plan to use in this project are ones I have used a lot, like typescript, shadcnUI etc, the spicy new additions that I do not at all know how to use yet are react-three-fiber (RTF going forward) and drei, two libraries for using the Three.js webGL library within a react project. 

Some relevant resources are found in these docs pages:
- [Three.js docs](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene)
- [React-three-fiber docs](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction)
- [Live preview of a demo of what I am going for that someone else built](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/animated-solarsystem-with-react-three-fiber-2-1-w821r?file=%2Fpackage.json)

## Initial setup
Nothing new or interesting is expected here, scaffolding the project with vite and adding dependancies, then removing boilerplate.

After that will set up an initial "scene" using RTF and start experimenting with adding objects before making a real start on the solar system.
