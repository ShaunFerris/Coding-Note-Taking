#projects 

This project is undertaken for a client, so notes here will be annonymised like previous client projects.

## General brief
Client operates a new small business in garden design, has a squarespace site setup and hosted for marketing the business. Client has requested consultation to polish the sites presentation, on-boarding experience for customers, and to add new features.

Initial top level requirements given by the client are below, with additional notes added by me in <span style="color: cyan;">blue</span>:
1. Introduce brand - apply consistently across site, color palette and logo. <span style="color: cyan;">Logo exists, site has a color system already, but I may need to formalise the color palette in a design document</span>
2. Design standards - quality, consistent and accessible web design and navigation standards. <span style="color: cyan;">Don't think the site currently conforms to aria standards, look into squarespace plugins that address this</span>
3. State problem that the buisiness solves - is the problem solution statement clear? <span style="color: cyan;">This one is essentially just a re-write of the main page copy</span>
4. Introduce client/business - does the front page do enough? Is it trying to cover too much? Is it messy and off putting? <span style="color: cyan;">Another copy re-write/consult. Compile a design document with examples of competitors/comparable buisnesses and present client with re-write options based on successful examples</span>
5. Showcase work - Are there better plugins for showcasing work visually?
6. Contact/consultation form - Is there a way to make the form feel more fun and engaging, so it feels personal and not like a chore. <span style="color: cyan;">This might be a tough one, again will come down to competitor research</span>
7. Explain services and process - Are the services explained clearly and does the process make sense? <span style="color: cyan;">More consult/rewriting of copy</span>
8. Mobile optimisation - layouts currently go awry on mobile
9. Blog (currently unpublished as there has not been content added.) - select and implement a bloggin plugin, likely with a cms too. Client expects to write one or two posts a month and drive traffic through crossposts to insta/socials.
10. Instagram feed plugin - Removed because not sure where best to locate it. <span style="color: cyan;">My input here will be how to best integrate socials into the site, this will be another point in the design doc</span>
11. Landing pages - Blogs/ marketing will often require a dedicated landing page. Would it be sensible to develop 2-3 templates? <span style="color: cyan;">Clarify with client what they mean by this</span>
12. Whats missing? Both visually and content wise, what is the site lacking? <span style="color: cyan;">Pretty general consult point here, again will rely on research</span>

## Design doc
My approach to this project will start with a fairly simple first actionable step, putting together a design research document. This document will be shared with/collabed on by the client. The steps to take here are:
1. Compile which of the provided requirements are directly related to design decisions as opposed to functionality/plugin selection
2. Compile a small number of successful sites that fill the same purpose in the same or similar industry
3. Present answers to design questions in the requirements based on successful comparison sites

Addressing point 1, I think it makes sense to recategorize the requirements into three classes, copywriting, visual design and functionality. Note that for the sake of brevity, I will reword some of the requirements .

### Copy reqs
Points 3, 4 and 7 from the reqs list
1. Problem solution statement for the business
2. Introduction to the owner/operator and their philosophy
3. Service explanation/summary
Going from the copy on the existing site, the through line in the branding is built around creating a sense of place. I think this is great and the copy can be streamlined around this concept. It is currently a little too verbose.

### Visual reqs
Points 1, 5, 11
1. Brand consistency
2. Work showcase - carousels/gallery/portfolio page etc
3. Landing pages

### Functionality reqs
Points 2, 6, 8, 9, 10
1. Design standards and accessibility
2. Contact form - make this interactive??
3. Mobile optimization
4. Blog functionality
5. Instagram plugin integration

Addressing point 2, these are the industry examples I think are worth looking at:
