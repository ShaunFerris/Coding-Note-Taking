The general idea for this project is to take the idea of the marketing and registration site that I built  for a clients conference, and rebuild it into a boilerplate package that can be used to easily spin up a site that gives information about a thing or event, and allows users to register either to attend the event or to receive information about the product.

## This project idea is on hold as of 20.02.2024 - come back to it later
