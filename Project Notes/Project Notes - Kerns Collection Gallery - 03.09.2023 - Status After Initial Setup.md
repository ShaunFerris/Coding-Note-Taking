At this point the bones of the site are up and running as a multi-page next.js app. While I originally invisaged that the site would be one single page delimitted by scroll jacking between sections, this ended up seeming quite impractical once I got a better idead of what the client wanted, and they were more than happy with a multi-page website. This will also make it much easier to incorporate heavier features down the line if necessary.

The main tasks to going forward from here are:
1. Make layouts for the contact and about routes
2. Work on the styling and design of the homepage (also the contact and about routes once they are made)
3. Add slideshow functionality to the gallery route modal.

Item three on the list is by far the most interesting technical problem and will also really add to the level of polish I am trying to achieve, so I will likely be doing this one first. Because this is the most interesting/difficult technical challenge of the site, I will keep a dev diary page that just discusses work on this aspect: [[Project Notes - Art Collection Gallery - Modal Slideshow Development]]
