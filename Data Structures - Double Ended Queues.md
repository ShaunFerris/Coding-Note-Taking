#dsa #queues 

The double ended queue, or dequeue (pronounced **_deck_**) is an abstract data structure that is essentially just like the queue, except it supports insertion and deletion at both ends of the structure.

The dequeue ADT is more general than both the standard stack and queue structures, having more flexibility. The dequeue is a symmetrical abstraction, so it needs methods for identical operations at both ends of the list. It needs to be able to add and remove from either end, and it will need accessor methods for returning the current first element and the current last element, the length and and isEmpty boolean.
