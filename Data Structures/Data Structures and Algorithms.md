This note will serve as the hub for notes related to DSA topics. I will attempt to keep these notes language agnostic, but in all likelyhood will use python for the examples.

Data Structures notes:
- [[Data Structures - Using Arrays]]
- [[Data Structures - Linked Lists]]
- [[Data Structures - Objects and dictionaries]]
- [[Data Structures - Memory and How Arrays Work]]
- [[Data Structures - Hash Tables Dictionaries and Associative Arrays]]

Also, for constructing custom data structures, revise OOP in python starting from here:
- [[Python - OOP - Introduction]]

Algorithm Notes:
- [[Algorithms - Algorithmic Complexity]]
- [[Algorithms - Big O Notation]]
- [[Algorithms - Space Complexity]]
