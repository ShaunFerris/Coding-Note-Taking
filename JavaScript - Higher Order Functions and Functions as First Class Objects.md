As its name suggests, functional programming is centered around a theory of functions.
The use of higher order functions is closely linked to functional programming as a paradigm:
[[General - Functional Programming]].

It would make sense to be able to pass them as arguments to other functions, and return a function from another function. Functions are considered first class objects in JavaScript, which means they can be used like any other object. They can be saved in variables, stored in an object, or passed as function arguments.

## Higher order functions for working on arrays in JS
Relevant: [[Data Structures - Using Arrays]]

### The map method
Let's start with some simple array functions, which are methods on the array object prototype. In this exercise we are looking at `Array.prototype.map()`, or more simply `map`.

The `map` method iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function on each element. It does this without mutating the original array.

When the callback is used, it is passed three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the `map` method was called.

See below for an example using the `map` method on the `users` array to return a new array containing only the names of the users as elements. For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.
```js
const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const names = users.map(user => user.name);
console.log(names);
```
The console would display the value `[ 'John', 'Amy', 'camperCat' ]`.

### The filter method
Another useful array function is `Array.prototype.filter()`, or simply `filter()`.

`filter` calls a function on each element of an array and returns a new array containing only the elements for which that function returns a truthy value - that is, a value which returns `true` if passed to the `Boolean()` constructor. In other words, it filters the array, based on the function passed to it. Like `map`, it does this without needing to modify the original array.

The callback function accepts three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the `filter` method was called.

See below for an example using the `filter` method on the `users` array to return a new array containing only the users under the age of 30. For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.
```js
const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const usersUnder30 = users.filter(user => user.age < 30);
console.log(usersUnder30); 
```
The console would display the value `[ { name: 'Amy', age: 20 }, { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 } ]`.
