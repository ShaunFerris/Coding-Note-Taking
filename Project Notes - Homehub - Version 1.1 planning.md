This note is for the planning and brainstorming of features for the first major update to my home organization app HomeHub.

<blockquote style="color: cyan; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The objective of this update is to identify and implement in HomeHub, features that will show a level of complexity and poilsh that will set it apart from a generic todo/budget/shopping list app and make it more technically impressive to prospective future employers.</blockquote>
