Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features, and more boradly are sets of rules for approaching problem solving in programming.

## Object oriented programming
This involves storing data and the methods to operate on that data in discrete units called objects. See [[JavaScript - Objects]].

## Functional programming
Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope: `INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT`

Functional programming is about:
1.  Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change
2.  Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output
3.  Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

## Dynamic programming 
See the notes on solving problems with dynamic solutions here [[General - Dynamic Programming]].
