Debugging is the process of going through code to figure out and fix the reasons that it is not performing the way you want. The three main types of bug can be thought of as:
1. Syntax errors. These prevent the code from running
2. Runtime errors. These cause unexpected behaviour when the code does run.
3. Logical errors. These cause the code to perform it's task but not as intended.

In this note we will go ever general concepts around debugging. Specific notes about JS and python debuggers can be found:
