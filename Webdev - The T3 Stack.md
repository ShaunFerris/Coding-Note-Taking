#webdevSpecific 

T3 is a webdev stack that focusses on simplicity, modularity and typesaftey end to end. The docs are [here](https://create.t3.gg/en/introduction).

Going forward from today (20.08.2023) I am going to be picking this stack up. It builds on tech I already use like Next + React + TS, but introduces Trpc and Prisma connected to planetscale. The technologies put together in the stack offer a lot of great benefits to dev experience and the build quality of the final product, and work really well with service providers like Planetscale and Vercel that have extrememly generous free tiers with great dev ex.
