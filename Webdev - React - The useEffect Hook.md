The useEffect hook is used to execute some action is response to a change in a dependancy that is specified in the call to useEffect. Simply put, it is a hook that does something whenever something else happens or changes.

It is primarily used to perform side-effects in functional react components. In React terminology, a side-effect is an action that occurs outside the scope of a components rendering, like data fetching, or modifying the DOM directly through the browser API.

The useEffect hook takes two arguments, a callback function that executes the side effect or other action that you want to execute in response to a change, and an optional array of the dependancies you want to trigger the callback.
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  //No dependancies passed. Runs on every render
});

useEffect(() => {
  //Empty dependancy array. Runs only on the first render
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  //Runs on the first render
  //And any time any dependency value changes
}, [prop, state]);

```

The `useEffect` hook is essential for managing side effects in React functional components. It provides a way to separate concerns, keeping the rendering logic focused on UI updates while handling other actions in an isolated effect.
