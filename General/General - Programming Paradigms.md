Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features, and more boradly are sets of rules for approaching problem solving in programming.

## Imperative programming
The earliest and most natural programming paradigm. In English (and many other languages), the imperative tense is used to give commands. Similarly, an imperative style in programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task.

## Object oriented programming
This involves storing data and the methods to operate on that data in discrete units called objects. See [[JavaScript - Objects]] and [[Python - OOP - Introduction]]

## Functional programming
[[General - Functional Programming]]
Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope: `INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT`

## Dynamic programming 
See the notes on solving problems with dynamic solutions here [[General - Dynamic Programming]].
