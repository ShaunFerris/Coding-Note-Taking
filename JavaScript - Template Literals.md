#javascript #ES6 #strings #fstrings

A new feature of ES6 is the template literal. This is a special type of string that makes creating complex strings easier.

Template literals allow you to create multi-line strings and to use string interpolation features to create strings.

**They are essentially the JS answer to pythons f-strings**

Consider the code below:
```js
const person = {
  name: "Zodiac Hasbro",
  age: 56
};

const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${person.name}!
I am ${person.age} years old.`;

console.log(greeting);
```
A lot of things happened there. Firstly, the example uses backticks (`` ` ``), not quotes (`'` or `"`), to wrap the string. Secondly, notice that the string is multi-line, both in the code and the output. This saves inserting `\n` within strings. The `${variable}` syntax used above is a placeholder. Basically, you won't have to use concatenation with the `+` operator anymore. To add variables to strings, you just drop the variable in a template string and wrap it with `${` and `}`. Similarly, you can include other expressions in your string literal, for example `${a + b}`. This new way of creating strings gives you more flexibility to create robust strings.
