For a look at how to actually use arrays, the basic fundamentals of what they are, and some common useful methods for them in both python and JS, see [[Data Structures - Using Arrays]].

The contents of this note originally came from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=247cXLkYt2M&list=PLRL3Z3lpLmH0FiSWovfiBtxNczQg0Hzry&index=1) by simondev, title **Memory, cache locality and why arrays are fast**.

## Topics Covered
This is intended to be the first part of learning about data structures and optimization, and will cover:
- Understanding performance
- Talking about arrays
- Cool things your CPU does
- Why arrays are fast and when they are not
